            <p><b>Utdrag fra oblig 1 DATA1100 som omhandler gruppesamarbeid og gruppekontrakt:</b>
                <br>
                Imagine that one of your hypothetical co-workers starts missing many of the meetings. How would you best manage the situation within the group?
                <br>
                A fundamental basis is that every member of the group feels respinsibility of the assignment to be discussed in the group meetings. From there, one can have fruitful conversations about why the co-worker is missing out on meetings, and try to find soulutions to how the group work can proceed forward. This can be done by compromizing, perhaprs meeting at drifferent times, online instead of physically or rearrangements of areas of responsibility.
